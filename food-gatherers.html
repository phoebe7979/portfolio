    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Problem Statement</h2>
    <p>Every week, Food Gatherers receives up to five food recall notices from USDA and other public sectors. With tons of food donated every week from all kinds of sources, however, Food Gatherers finds it challenging to sort the bulk of donated food and keep the recalled items from further distribution. Currently, the organization selects recall notices manually and only posts fewer than 30 recall food notices in the warehouse a time, resulting in the risk of serving tainted food to distribution channels. A better procedure is therefore urgently needed in order to ensure no tainted food is distrubuted to downstream pantries.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Role</h2>
    <p>For this project, I worked with four other classmates from the Master of Science in Information program as a team. As every of our team members are extremely participatory, we take turns managing meetings, leading discussions, and documenting data.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Qualitative Research</h2>
    <p>To understand the scope of the problem and its root causes, we conducted qualitative research both individually and collaboratively.</p><br>
    <h4>1. Background Research</h4><br>
    <p>In order to aquire a comprehensive understanding of our client, each team member worked separately to research on one aspect of the problem. I opted to analyze other food banks in the state of Michigan. <br><br>
    By gathering information from academic and organization website resources, I compared and contrasted all seven food banks in Michigan in terms of the following topics:<br>
    <li>Background</li>
    <li>Vision and focuses</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>Services, including regions, channels, and amount of food served</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <li>Resources</li>
    <br>
    </p><br>
    <h4>2. Various attendee backgrounds</h4><br>
    <p>Synology 2018 would be receiving attendees from various backgrounds -- participants could be representatives from local sales channels, tech media, vendor partners, and end users, which may be either business users or home users. The goal of the event was not only to introduce our latest solution roadmap, but also to facilitate interaction between our users, further strengthening the Synology community. Therefore the new products and solutions may not be of everyone’s interest, the event should still be able to keep each participant entertained.  </p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Solution</h2><br>
    <img src="imgs/synology2018/overview-885x367.jpg" alt="venue overview"/><br>
    <br>
    <h4>1. Reduced session duration</h4><br>
    <p>In order to ensure the messages during the event can be effectively delivered to the attendees, we have reduced event duration to three hours, as opposed to four hours in the previous year. In addition, three food stations were situated in the venue to provide early arriving guests energy for the upcoming presentations. A 20-minute break was also inserted between the two main presentation sessions. This way, participants can take the chance to digest the presentation while interacting with engineers at the demo booths for hands-on experience of the new solutions introduced previously. </p><br>
    <h4>2. Additional entertainment</h4><br>
    <p>To keep the audience entertained throughout the event and to retain as many attendees as possible until the very end of the event, we have created a series of activities alongside with the main show sessions. These include two social media sharing and event questionnaire activities with exclusive giveaways, as well as a total of eight demonstration and display booths which attendees can visit. Additionally, to provide a facilitative atmosphere for business networking and user interaction, alcohol was also offered with roaming service. Lastly, a lucky draw session was included at the very end of event to encourage our guests to stay until the event ends.</p>
    <br>
    <h2 class = "project-content-section-name">Results</h2><br>
    <p>The event went very successful. Not only did we have high turnout rate, but guests enjoyed the event as well. Some testimonials gathered from event questionnaire are shown below:</p>
    <p><li>Very well organised and professionally run.</li></p>
    <li>It's wonderful experience, it covers more than I've learned, thank you!</li>
    <li>Great event, I can't wait to see wht you accomplish in the next 12 months.</li>
    <li>Thank you so much for the best event yet!!!!</li></p><br>
