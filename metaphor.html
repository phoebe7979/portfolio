    <p>The present study takes vocabulary from the metaphor “BUSINESS IS WAR” as an example to explore the effects of metaphor as supplemented learning strategy on learning. Previous studies have indicated the facilitation effects of metaphor awareness on short-term and long-term vocabulary and idiom acquisition (Boers, 2000b; Guo, 2007). Still, some researches have shown that learners are not able to utilize the enhanced awareness of conceptual metaphor for the comprehension of newly encountered words and expressions (Boers, 2000a; Condon, 2008), or to categorize new vocabulary into existed principles (Beréndi et al., 2008). Our research reports a learning experiment that examines whether enhancing metaphoric awareness facilitates reading comprehension of business-related passages and learning outcomes of Mandarin business vocabulary. <br><br>The results showed that (i) overall, the experimental group outperformed the control group in the posttest; (ii) after the learning phase, both the experimental group and the control group have demonstrated significant growth in terms of the vocabulary knowledge of the target words, but no significant difference was found between the two groups; (iii) in the blank-filling task in the delayed-posttest, the experimental group had significantly more corrected answers than the controls, and this advantage was also found for the new metaphoric nouns. The results indicated that awareness of cognitive metaphor cannot immediately enhance reading comprehension of the learners, but can be facilitative for the learning and memory of metaphoric vocabulary.
